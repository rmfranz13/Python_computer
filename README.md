Virtual computer built from first principles

This is an attempt to build a computer from first principles, roughly following the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. 

While the book itself does not use python, my goal is to re-build the architecture using python. At first, following the book's advice and using only the fundamental Nand gate and D-flip-flop, but then optimizing using only python built-ins and the python standard library (and maybe, just maybe something to act as a virtual computer monitor when needed... unsure if python offers anything to help there).

The primary goal here is to build a computer completely from python functions, such that anyone who understands python can also understand how a basic but fully-functional computer works. In other words, everything is to be visible and accessible to an individual whose only tool is python, so there is no other confusion or software troubles that can hinder a complete understanding of how the virtual computer works all the way from fundamental gates, to the operating system, to high-level programming and games.

Secondary goals are optimizing the system after it is built (still sticking to python built-ins) and possibly developing more sophisticated computer systems once the underlying architecture is fully understood. Would also be very cool to eventually work out simplistic versions of popular operating systems like Windows or Linux. 

Not sure how to do legal stuff but my wish is for anyone to be able to contribute (I think I need a license though?), please don't spill coffee on yourself and blame this repo. Thanks.

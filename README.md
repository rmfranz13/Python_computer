# Python_computer
This is an attempt to build a computer from first principles, roughly following the book ["The Elements of Computing Systems"](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. I highly recommed the book which literally explains every necessary detail. They use a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/), so I'm legally free to share this. However, my goal is not to provide answers (the verbatim answers are already freely available) but to act as a working example written entirely in Python.

While the book itself does not use Python, my goal is to re-build the architecture completely in Python, removing the need to understand the free software they provide (which is very useful if you are building the computer yourself, but not useful if you want to see something that already works (plus all the perks of Python)). At first, I plan to follow the book's instruction using only the fundamental Nand gate, but then optimizing using only Python built-ins and the Python standard library as needed to improve performance. Though optimizing away from the fundamental Nand gate is frowned upon because it is a disconnect in the understanding that any black box can be constructed from Nand, perhaps there can be a 'proof that this black box can be implemented from Nand' object, before using a more optimal yet abstract solution. Additionally, this strict complience to Python is in effort to eliminate dependencies, so that anyone who can download Python can have the whole thing. The only exception is Tkinter, which is the most general gui toolkit I can find and is part of any standard Python installation.

Everything is to be visible and accessible to an individual whose only tool is Python, so there is no confusion or software troubles that can hinder a complete understanding of how a simple, non-optimal (yet not completely useless... hopefully) virtual computer works. From fundamental [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate), to the [assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language), to the [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler), to the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system), to high-level programming and games. It should make concrete all the low-level magic that makes a computer tick. As with any new python script, I'd recommend stepping through the code with a [debugger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) to get a feel for what's going on.

Secondary goals are optimizing the system after it is built (still sticking to Python built-ins) and possibly developing more sophisticated computer systems once the underlying architecture is fully understood. Could see this eventually turning into a not-completely-useless virtual machine. Sky's the limit really. Let's see what Python can do!

# Python_computer
This is an attempt to build a computer from first principles, roughly following the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. 

While the book itself does not use python, my goal is to re-build the architecture completely in python, removing the need to understand the free software they provide (which is very useful if you are building the computer yourself but not useful if you are stubborn like me and don't want to rely on any help). At first, I plan to follow the book's instruction using only the fundamental Nand gate, but then optimizing using only python built-ins and the python standard library. In an effort to eliminate dependencies I plan to only use Python itself and tkinter (which comes standard with Python) for a human interface.

Everything is to be visible and accessible to an individual whose only tool is python, so there is no confusion or software troubles that can hinder a complete understanding of how a simple yet not completely useless virtual computer works from fundamental logic gates, to the assembler, to the compiler, to the operating system, to high-level programming and games.

Secondary goals are optimizing the system after it is built (still sticking to python built-ins) and possibly developing more sophisticated computer systems once the underlying architecture is fully understood. It would be very cool to eventually work out simplistic versions of popular operating systems like Windows or Linux, and could see this eventually turning into a crappy but easy-for-me-to-use-because-I-built-it virtual machine. Sky's the limit really. Let's see what python can do!

# Python_computer
This is an attempt to build a computer from first principles, roughly following the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. 

While the book itself does not use python, my goal is to re-build the architecture completely in python, removing the need to understand the free software they provide (which is very useful if you are building the computer yourself but not useful if you just want a working machine that you can immediately disect and analyze and understand). At first, I plan to follow the book's advice and using only the fundamental Nand gate, but then optimizing using only python built-ins and the python standard library. In an effort to eliminate dependencies (other than python itself), the only library I plan on using is tkinter for the keyboard and screen, which is typically included with the python standard library, and very easily installible otherwise.

Everything is to be visible and accessible to an individual whose only tool is python, so there is no confusion or software troubles that can hinder a complete understanding of how a simple yet surprisingly powerful virtual computer works from fundamental logic gates, to the operating system, to high-level programming and games.

Secondary goals are optimizing the system after it is built (still sticking to python built-ins) and possibly developing more sophisticated computer systems once the underlying architecture is fully understood. Would also be very cool to eventually work out simplistic versions of popular operating systems like Windows or Linux, and could see this eventually turning into a crappy but easy-to-use virtual machine toolkit. This is one project I keep coming back to more than others, and assuming this continues, sky's the limit really. Let's see what python can do! 

Also, not sure how to do legal stuff but my wish is for anyone to be able to contribute, please don't spill coffee on yourself and blame this repo. Thanks.
